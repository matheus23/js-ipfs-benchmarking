# Benchmarking pinning impact on js-ipfs performance

This repository should be used to reproduce the findings I wrote about in this issue: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/3759

The result should be two `.csv` files (and more if you want to create a couple with `createRegularIPFS`, too).
You can take a look at what the results were for in this google sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17lmGS0cfvBYFwVT01GNBVnpeFZqx0Ll0hnfQ62QCIfU/edit?usp=sharing

## How to run

```sh
$ yarn
$ node index.js
```
